# Tutorial on Information Geometry
(WIP)
This is a repository for a tutorial on information geometry, using JAX. The overarching goal is to lay the complete groundwork for illustrating ideas from the field. This is heavily based on the book [Methods of Information Geometry](https://bookstore.ams.org/mmono-191). Since implementing the primitives (e.g. manifolds, metrics, etc.) of differential geometry in a programming language is nontrivial, I referenced the [geomstats library](https://github.com/geomstats/) for design inspiration.
